This application is a project built over part 10 of University of Helsinki's [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
1. Install Node and npm
1. The application connects to a [GraphQL API](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api) provided by the course.
Set up the API and store its address in the file `.env` as `APOLLO_URI` in the project root.
1. Set up one of the following environments: [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/), [iOS Simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/), or [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/expo-go).
Alternatively Expo's browser view can be used, but this might result in unexpected behaviour.

### Running the application
1. Start the API
1. Start a terminal in the project root
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
1. Visit the localhost port that has the Expo developer tools running
1. Run the application in the environment you chose in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
